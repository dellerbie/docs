# Synthesizers

Human ears hear between 20Hz * 20kHz

## 3 Elements of Sound
* Pitch
* Timbre
* Volume

## 5 Fundamental Waveforms
* Square
* Triangle
* Sawtooth
* Sine
* Pulse

## 7 Components of Every Synthesizer
* Oscillator (pitch)
    * Controls pitch
    * aka VCO, DCO
* Filter (brightness)
    * Controls timbre by filtering harmonics
    * Opening the filters allows higher frequency harmonics to pass through
      (brighter)
    * Closing the filter allows lower frequency harmonics (darker)
* Amplifier (volume)
    * aka VCA, DCA
* Volume Envelope
    * Sends instructions to the amplifier telling it to get louder, how long to
      stay at it’s peak volume, and when to get quieter.  How fast to get loud,
how loud to get, how long to stay there
    * ADSR (attack, decay, sustain, release)
    * Shape of the sound’s volume
* Filter Envelope
    * Sends instructions to the Filter to control the shape of the brightness of
      the sound
* Pitch Envelope
    * Sends instructions to the oscillator to control the shape of the pitch
* LFO (low frequency oscillator)
    * Oscillates at a frequency below our audible frequency of 20Hz
    * Used as a modulator
    * Routes to the Oscillator (vibrato), Amplifier (tremolo) or Filter
    * Makes things “wiggle”

## Different Kinds of Synthesizers

* Analog
    * Sounds generating in electronic circuitry
* Digital
    * Sounds generated through number crunching algorithms
* Additive
    * Adds one or more sine waves together to generate the harmonics you need
    * Needs an oscillator for each harmonic
* Subtractive
    * Start with a complex harmonic waveform
    * Subtract/Filter out harmonics until you get what you want
* FM (frequency modulation)
    * Modulating/multiplying one sine wave form with another
* Phase Distortion
* Samplers
